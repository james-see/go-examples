## What

Examples of libraries I use in golang frequently as a way for me to remember and hopefully useful for others making their way. Go get 'em. ;)

## 1 REDIS

The code is in redis1 folder, but just run main.go from root and it will run this along with the other examples. You must have redis installed locally for this to work.

It should print `PONG` to show it is connected.

## 2 coming soon
